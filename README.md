# Speech-to-text-conversion
A program that converts speech from .mp4, .mp3 or .wav files to text.
Key features:
1. Generates confidence level
2. Able to detect more than 1 speaker
3. Can generate word timestamps.

I used Google Cloud Platform for this project. To run this code, replace the json file link to the json file generated by your service google account, and the folder path to your folder that contains files to be converted.
Code produced for Hollo.hk.
